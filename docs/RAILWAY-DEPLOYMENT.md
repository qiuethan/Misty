# Railway Deployment (staging + production)

Deploys the platform's six backend services plus the discord-bot to Railway,
backed by Neon Postgres (a branch per environment) for the three services that
own a database. Repo-side config lives in each service's `Dockerfile` +
`railway.json`; the steps below are the account-side setup you run in the
Railway + Neon dashboards / CLIs.

| Railway service | Root dir | Database | Pre-deploy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `team-tracking` | `/` | Neon (own project) | `alembic upgrade head` | Deploy first — everything references it. |
| `documentation-system` | `/` | Neon (own project) | `alembic upgrade head` | Consumes team-tracking (hard dependency) and connectors (soft — recommended to deploy connectors first, not required). |
| `verification` | `/` | Neon (own project) | `alembic upgrade head` | Email one-time codes. |
| `llm` | `/` | **none** | — | Stateless Bedrock proxy; keys from `CONSUMER_KEYS`. |
| `meeting` | `/` | **none** | — | **Stateful in-memory**; keys from `CONSUMER_KEYS`. See the single-replica warning in step 2. |
| `connectors` | `/` | **none** | — | Stateless outbound adapter (Google Drive/Docs); keys from `CONSUMER_KEYS`. Recommended to deploy before `documentation-system` (not required) — see its `CONNECTORS_API_KEY` note in step 3. |
| `discord-bot` | `discord-bot` | none | — | Node; the only consumer-facing surface. |

All seven are **private** — no public domains. They reach each other over
Railway's internal network as `<service>.railway.internal:<PORT>`.

## Prerequisites
- A Railway account + the `railway` CLI (`railway login`).
- A Neon account.
- `uv` locally (for the key-provisioning script and the key-minting CLIs).
- An AWS account with Bedrock **and** Amazon Transcribe enabled in your
  `AWS_REGION`, for `llm` and `meeting` respectively.

## Branching + auto-deploy model
Each Railway environment is wired to a git branch. Merging a PR flips a deploy.

```
feature branch  ──PR──▶  staging  ──PR──▶  main
                          │                  │
                          ▼                  ▼
                    Railway staging   Railway production
                    (auto-deploy)     (auto-deploy)
```

- **`staging`** is the integration branch. Feature PRs target it (it's the repo
  default). Every merge auto-deploys to the `staging` Railway environment
  (staging Neon branch + staging Discord app).
- **`main`** is the release branch. **PRs to `main` may only come from
  `staging`** — enforced by the `main-source-guard` workflow
  ([`.github/workflows/main-source-guard.yml`](../.github/workflows/main-source-guard.yml)),
  which fails any PR to `main` whose head is not `staging`. Every merge to
  `main` auto-deploys to the `production` Railway environment.
- Both branches are protected; all four CI checks are required.

## 1. Neon: databases + branches
Create **three Neon projects** — `team-tracking`, `documentation-system`, and
`verification` (each service owns its own DB). In each project you get a `main`
branch (= production); create a second branch named `staging` (copy-on-write
from main). Copy the six connection strings (3 projects × 2 branches). Use the
`postgresql+psycopg://…` form (append `?sslmode=require` if not present).

`llm`, `meeting`, and `connectors` have no database — nothing to provision for them here.

## 2. Railway: project, environments, services
1. Create a Railway project; it starts with a `production` environment — add a
   `staging` environment too.
2. Add seven services from this repo:
   - The six Python services (`team-tracking`, `documentation-system`,
     `verification`, `llm`, `meeting`, `connectors`). Their Dockerfiles build from the **repo
     root** as context (so `packages/` is reachable) and install their workspace
     member with `uv sync --frozen --no-dev --package <name>` into a venv at
     `/app/.venv`. So each one's Railway **root directory is `/`**, with
     `railway.json` → `dockerfilePath` pointing at
     `services/<name>/Dockerfile`.
   - `discord-bot` — Node, unaffected by the workspace change; its root
     directory stays `discord-bot`.

   Railway picks up each service's `railway.json` (Dockerfile build, start
   command, health check, and — for the three DB-backed services only — the
   `alembic upgrade head` pre-deploy step). `llm`, `meeting`, and `connectors`
   have no `preDeployCommand` because they have no schema.
3. Keep **every** service private (no public domain). The bot needs no domain.
4. **Pin `meeting` to a single replica.** It keeps each live meeting's session
   entirely in process memory, so a given `session_id`'s WebSocket,
   `/transcript` polls, and `/stop` call must all land on the same process.
   Scaling it horizontally without sticky routing on `session_id` misroutes
   `/stop` to a process that never saw the meeting, and the recording is lost.
   Every other service is stateless and scales freely.

## 3. Environment variables
Set these per environment (staging vs production) per service.

**The three DB-backed services:**

| Var | team-tracking | documentation-system | verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | tt Neon branch | docs Neon branch | verification Neon branch |
| `API_KEY` | a strong random secret | a strong random secret | a strong random secret |
| env tier | `TT_ENV` = `staging`/`production` | — | `VF_ENV` = `staging`/`production` |
| `PORT` | `8000` | `8000` | `8000` |
| `DIRECTORY_BASE_URL` | — | `http://${{team-tracking.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{team-tracking.PORT}}` | — |
| `DIRECTORY_API_KEY` | — | *(set by the provisioning script — step 4)* | — |
| `CONNECTORS_BASE_URL` | — | `http://${{connectors.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{connectors.PORT}}` | — |
| `CONNECTORS_API_KEY` | — | a `connectors` consumer key with the `fetch` scope — see step 4b | — |
| `CODE_HMAC_SECRET` | — | — | a strong random secret |
| `EMAIL_BACKEND` | — | — | `resend` (or `gmail`) — **not** `fake` |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | — | — | `UTMIST <noreply@utmist.ca>` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | — | — | from Resend |

> **documentation-system boots fine without `CONNECTORS_API_KEY`.** Unlike
> `API_KEY`/`DIRECTORY_API_KEY`, `verify_production_secrets()` only logs a
> startup warning if it's still on the dev default outside `local` — it does
> not fail the deploy. Without it, Google-source fetches (`gdocs`, `gsheets`,
> `gslides`, `gdrive`) fail and are recorded as per-doc ingest warnings; the
> catalog itself still works. Deploying connectors before documentation-system
> is still recommended so Google fetches work from the start, but it is not
> required — see the deploy order below.

**The three DB-free services:**

| Var | llm | meeting | connectors |
|---|---|---|---|
| env tier | `LLM_ENV` = `staging`/`production` | `MEETING_ENV` = `staging`/`production` | `CONNECTORS_ENV` = `staging`/`production` |
| `API_KEY` | a strong random secret | a strong random secret | a strong random secret |
| `CONSUMER_KEYS` | JSON array — see step 4b | JSON array — see step 4b | JSON array — see step 4b |
| `PORT` | `8000` | `8000` | `8000` |
| `AWS_REGION` | e.g. `us-east-1` (Bedrock) | e.g. `us-east-1` (Transcribe) | — |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | yes | yes | — |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` / `LLM_MODEL` | `bedrock-converse` / `claude-sonnet-4-6` | — | — |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | — | `http://${{llm.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{llm.PORT}}` | — |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | — | an `llm` consumer key with the `chat` scope | — |
| `MAX_MEETING_MS` | — | optional; defaults to the 4h backstop | — |
| `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` | — | — | base64 Google service-account key; empty is a valid running state (Google fetches 503, rest of the service works) |

> Bedrock usage bills as **Amazon Bedrock** (credits apply) — do *not* point
> `llm` at Claude Platform on AWS.

**discord-bot:**

| Var | Value |
|---|---|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | staging app / prod app token |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | per app |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | test guild (staging) / blank (prod) |
| `ENABLE_DISCORD` / `ENABLE_WEB` | `true` / `false` |
| `DIRECTORY_BASE_URL` / `DIRECTORY_API_KEY` | team-tracking; key set by the provisioning script |
| `DOC_BASE_URL` / `DOC_API_KEY` | documentation-system |
| `VERIFICATION_BASE_URL` / `VERIFICATION_API_KEY` | verification |
| `MEETING_BASE_URL` / `MEETING_API_KEY` | meeting; a `meetings`-scoped consumer key |
| `MEETING_WS_URL` | *optional* — derived from `MEETING_BASE_URL` if unset |

Each `*_BASE_URL` follows the same private-network template shape, e.g.
`http://${{meeting.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{meeting.PORT}}`.

> **`MEETING_BASE_URL` is the `/record` kill switch.** Leave it unset and the
> bot boots normally; `/record` just answers "not configured". That's the
> intended way to register commands in an environment where `meeting` isn't
> provisioned yet.

> **Why `PORT=8000` explicitly?** `${{team-tracking.PORT}}` in the consumers'
> `DIRECTORY_BASE_URL` only resolves when `PORT` is an explicit Railway variable.
> Railway's dynamically-injected `PORT` isn't visible to cross-service template
> refs. Without this, `DIRECTORY_BASE_URL` resolves to `http://…railway.internal:`
> (empty port) and every bot → team-tracking call fails with "directory
> temporarily unavailable." One of the three real bugs shipped through the
> branching flow — see [`DEPLOYMENT-HISTORY.md`](DEPLOYMENT-HISTORY.md).

Generate the `API_KEY` values locally so nothing sensitive appears in a shell
transcript:
```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```
Twelve of them — one per backend service per environment (plus
`CODE_HMAC_SECRET` for verification). Paste into Railway's variable dashboard,
never into a file.

**Deploy order matters for the hard dependencies below; connectors is a
recommended-but-not-required exception.** In each environment:

1. **team-tracking first** — its `preDeployCommand` runs `alembic upgrade head`
   against the environment's Neon branch, which the provisioning script (next)
   depends on.
2. **connectors** — recommended before documentation-system so Google-source
   fetches work immediately, but not required: documentation-system boots
   fine without connectors reachable or `CONNECTORS_API_KEY` set (see step 4b
   and the warning above) — it just can't fetch Google content until then.
3. **documentation-system + verification** — they migrate the same way as
   team-tracking.
4. **`llm` before `meeting`** — `meeting` needs `LLM_BASE_URL` pointing at a
   running `llm`, and refuses to boot without it outside `local`.
5. **discord-bot last** — it consumes all of the above.

## 4a. Provision the directory keys
Once team-tracking is up + migrated in an environment, mint + wire the scoped
consumer keys:

```bash
railway login          # once
TT_DATABASE_URL="<team-tracking Neon branch DATABASE_URL for this env>" \
  ./scripts/provision-directory-key.sh staging      # then: production
```

This issues scoped `team-tracking-keys` for discord-bot + documentation-system
and sets each service's `DIRECTORY_API_KEY`. The discord-bot key's scopes
include `people:elevate` (alongside its `people:*`/`teams:*`/`memberships:*`
scopes) so its `/seed` can promote people to `admin`/`superuser` — plain
`people:write` cannot set a non-`member` `access_level`. The
documentation-system key stays read-only (`people:read teams:read`). Re-running issues a fresh key and
repoints the consumer; the previous key stays active until you revoke it
manually (`team-tracking-keys revoke <id>`).

> **Gotcha — `src` package collision when minting keys.** Both
> `services/team-tracking` and `services/documentation-system` declare a top-level
> `src` package, each with a console script pointing at `src.cli:main`
> (`team-tracking-keys` and `doc-keys` respectively — see their
> `[project.scripts]`). In the shared workspace venv these collide, so a bare
> `team-tracking-keys …` can resolve **documentation-system's** CLI and mint a
> `doc_`-envelope key. team-tracking's auth rejects that: `parse_prefix`
> ([`packages/auth/platform_auth/hashing.py`](../packages/auth/platform_auth/hashing.py))
> returns `None` for any token that doesn't start with the `tt_` envelope, so the
> key is dead on arrival. This actually bit us during key provisioning. Always
> invoke the CLI with the project pinned —
> `uv --project services/team-tracking run team-tracking-keys …`, which
> `scripts/provision-directory-key.sh` already does — and **verify the minted
> token's prefix is `tt_`, not `doc_`, before wiring it as `DIRECTORY_API_KEY`.**

## 4b. Provision the `llm` + `meeting` + `connectors` consumer keys (manual)

`llm`, `meeting`, and `connectors` have **no `api_keys` table** — their keys live in a
`CONSUMER_KEYS` JSON array env var, parsed into an in-memory store at boot. So
`provision-directory-key.sh` does not cover them; this step is manual, and you
repeat it per environment.

Three keys are needed:

```bash
# 1. A key for meeting -> llm (scope: chat)
uv --project services/llm run llm-keys --name meeting --scopes chat

# 2. A key for discord-bot -> meeting (scope: meetings)
uv --project services/meeting run meeting-keys --name discord-bot --scopes meetings

# 3. A key for documentation-system -> connectors (scope: fetch)
uv --project services/connectors run connectors-keys --name documentation-system --scopes fetch
```

Each CLI prints the **plaintext key to stdout** (shown exactly once — it is
argon2-hashed, never recoverable) and the `CONSUMER_KEYS` **JSON entry to
stderr**. Wire them like this:

| Printed to stderr (the JSON entry) | Printed to stdout (the plaintext key) |
|---|---|
| append to `llm`'s `CONSUMER_KEYS` array | set as `meeting`'s `LLM_API_KEY` |
| append to `meeting`'s `CONSUMER_KEYS` array | set as `discord-bot`'s `MEETING_API_KEY` |
| append to `connectors`'s `CONSUMER_KEYS` array | set as `documentation-system`'s `CONNECTORS_API_KEY` |

Then redeploy the service whose `CONSUMER_KEYS` you changed — the store is
built at boot, so the new key isn't live until it restarts.

**Revocation is a redeploy.** There is no `revoke` command; drop the entry from
`CONSUMER_KEYS` and redeploy. `CONSUMER_KEYS` must stay a JSON **array** —
both services reject any other shape at boot, deliberately, so a malformed
variable fails the deploy rather than silently disabling auth.

## 5. Register Discord slash commands
The bot has to tell Discord which slash commands it supports. Re-run whenever the
command set changes (new commands, beta→stable promotions, option tweaks). It's
idempotent — safe to re-run.

Use the wrapper so you register **both** environments in one go and can't
accidentally skip staging (a partial run leaves stale duplicate guild commands —
see #38). It always does staging first:

```bash
cd discord-bot
npm run register:all          # staging, then production
```

To target a single environment: `npm run register:staging` or
`npm run register:production`. There's also a guarded shell wrapper that prompts
before touching production: `./scripts/register.sh all` (or `staging` /
`production`).

> **Not** `npm run register` — that hardcodes `--env-file=.env` and only hits
> your **local test bot**. The `register:*` scripts (and `register.sh`) are the
> Railway-targeted ones; Railway injects each environment's secrets.

Under the hood each script runs
`railway run --service discord-bot --environment <env> -- node src/registerCommands.js`.

The script partitions commands into **stable** (registered globally — visible
in every server the bot is in) and **beta** (registered only to
`DISCORD_GUILD_ID` if set). Because we set `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` on staging and
leave it blank in production, staging gets `beta` commands in the test guild
only, and production correctly skips them.

Global registrations can take up to ~1 hour to propagate through Discord's
cache. Guild-scoped (staging) commands appear instantly.

> **Provision `meeting` before registering in an environment.** `/record` is now
> stable and registers globally, so it becomes visible to every member the
> moment you register. If `meeting` isn't deployed there (or `MEETING_BASE_URL`
> is unset on the bot) the command answers "not configured" — visible but
> useless. Either provision `meeting` first, or accept the degraded state
> knowingly.

## 6. Seed the first admin
Nobody is a directory admin on a fresh production DB. Seed yourself as a
`superuser` so you can grant others. Two ways:

**Option A — Neon SQL editor** (fastest for a one-off):
```sql
INSERT INTO people (display_name, primary_email, access_level, created_by, updated_by)
VALUES ('Your Name', 'you@example.com', 'superuser', 'manual-seed', 'manual-seed')
ON CONFLICT (primary_email) DO UPDATE
  SET access_level = 'superuser',
      updated_by   = 'manual-seed',
      updated_at   = now()
RETURNING id, display_name, primary_email, access_level;
```
Idempotent (upserts on `primary_email`). Run in the **team-tracking → main
branch** for production, or `staging` branch for staging.

**Option B — the seed CLI** (more auditable / scriptable):
```bash
TT_DB="<team-tracking Neon branch URL for this env>"
DATABASE_URL="$TT_DB" \
  uv --project services/team-tracking run team-tracking-seed seed-person \
    --name "Your Name" --email you@example.com --level superuser
```

After that, use `/link` in Discord (staging test guild or the real server) to
attach your Discord account to the seeded person record. New admins get added
by an existing admin running `/seed` from Discord.

## 7. Verify
- **APIs:** for each of the six services —
  `railway run --service <name> --environment <env> -- bash -c 'curl -s localhost:$PORT/health'`
  → `{"status":"ok"}`. `/health` is unauthenticated on every service, so no key
  is needed. For the three DB-backed ones, pre-deploy logs should also show
  `alembic upgrade head` ran.
- **Bot:** Railway logs show `Bot ready as …` — staging bot appears in the test guild; prod bot registers globally.
- **End-to-end (directory):** run a bot command (e.g. `/whoami`) in the staging guild → reaches staging team-tracking → staging Neon branch. If it returns "directory is temporarily unavailable," the two most common causes are (1) `DIRECTORY_BASE_URL` template not resolving (see the `PORT=8000` note above), or (2) `DIRECTORY_API_KEY` missing on the consumer (re-run the provisioning script).
- **End-to-end (`/record`):** join a staging voice channel, `/record start`,
  talk for ~30s, `/record stop`. Within roughly 30–60s a `meeting-minutes.pdf`
  should be posted to the text channel. This exercises the whole chain —
  bot → `meeting` (WS) → Transcribe → `llm` → Bedrock → PDF. Failure modes to
  check in order: `MEETING_API_KEY` wrong (WS closes with code 1008),
  `LLM_API_KEY`/`LLM_BASE_URL` wrong on `meeting` (PDF arrives with degraded,
  unsummarized minutes rather than failing), or AWS credentials missing
  (transcript comes back empty).

## Notes
- All six Python Dockerfiles build with the repo root as context and
  `uv sync --frozen --no-dev --package <name>` to install just that workspace
  member (plus the shared `platform_auth` leaf from `packages/auth`) — that's
  why their Railway root directory is `/` while `discord-bot`'s stays
  `discord-bot`.
- **`meeting`'s image needs no `ffmpeg` binary.** Opus decode runs in-process
  via PyAV, which bundles its own ffmpeg libraries, and nothing shells out.
- **Nothing from a meeting outlives it.** No database, no object store, and no
  disk writes at all — audio streams straight to AWS Transcribe and is dropped.
  If the minutes matter, the PDF the bot posted to Discord is the only copy.
- APIs bind **`--host 0.0.0.0`**. Railway's IPv6 private network routes to the
  container's port regardless of the bind family, and `0.0.0.0` is what
  Railway's healthcheck reaches (an IPv6-only bind like `::` fails healthcheck
  on Debian's default kernel config). If service-to-service calls
  (bot → team-tracking) fail, check the `DIRECTORY_BASE_URL` reference next.
- Staging uses the **separate staging Discord application** + private test guild,
  so staging commands never touch the real UTMIST server.
- The `sh -c` wrapper on the API `startCommand` is deliberate — see the second
  bug in [`DEPLOYMENT-HISTORY.md`](DEPLOYMENT-HISTORY.md).
