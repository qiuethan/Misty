"""Guard against a wrapped secret reaching code that expects a plain `str`.

Every service stores its credentials as `pydantic.SecretStr` (see this
package's README, "Credential config convention"). `SecretStr` deliberately
does not coerce to `str`, so the caller must unwrap at the boundary with
`.get_secret_value()`. Forgetting to is easy and the resulting failure is
obscure — `secrets.compare_digest` reports a missing `.encode()`, and a
`SecretStr` instance is *always* truthy, so an `if not value:` emptiness check
silently stops guarding.

This module turns that into one sentence naming the parameter and the fix.

Duck-typed on purpose: `platform_auth` is a leaf that depends only on
fastapi/starlette/argon2, and importing pydantic here just to `isinstance`
against `SecretStr` would drag a new declared dependency into it. Anything
exposing `get_secret_value` is a secret wrapper for our purposes — which also
covers `SecretBytes` and any equivalent from another library.
