# connectors

Thin, stateless HTTP API that fetches document content from external sources on behalf of UTMIST's internal consumers: one `POST /fetch` endpoint, scoped API-key auth, no database.

## What this service does

Consumers like documentation-system want the text of a Google Doc (or, later, other source types) without holding source credentials themselves. connectors is an **outbound adapter**: it owns the Google service-account key and the source-specific fetch/export logic, and returns plain text.

Two things this service deliberately is **not**:

- **Not a gateway.** It does not sit in front of other UTMIST services or route traffic to them.
- **Not an authorization boundary.** It authenticates the *caller* (via a scoped API key) but never learns *who the caller is fetching on behalf of* — there is no per-end-user identity in the request. Access control for the underlying document is whatever the source system enforces (for Google, Drive's own sharing settings on the service account's email). A consumer that needs to enforce "can this particular user see this doc" must do that itself before calling `/fetch`.

Like `llm`, it is stateless — no database, no migrations, no persisted key store. API keys are seeded from a config env var at boot.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). No Docker or database needed for local dev; Google credentials are optional (see below).

```bash
# 0. From the repo root, enter the service directory (all commands below run here)
cd services/connectors

# 1. Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Install dependencies (including dev tools)
uv sync --extra dev

# 3. Start the API server
uv run uvicorn src.api.app:app --reload --port 8005
```

> The repo is a single [uv workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/workspaces/) (root `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.uv.workspace] members = ["services/*", "packages/*"]`, one root `uv.lock`). connectors depends on the shared `platform-auth` package (`[tool.uv.sources] platform-auth = { workspace = true }`) but the commands above are unchanged — `uv sync` and `uv run pytest` work exactly as shown when run from this directory.

The API is now at `http://localhost:8005`. Interactive Swagger UI is at `http://localhost:8005/docs`; the machine-readable schema is at `http://localhost:8005/openapi.json`.

The default dev bootstrap key is `dev-api-key-change-me` (set in `.env`, carries the `admin` wildcard scope). Pass it as `X-API-Key` on every request:

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8005/fetch \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source_id": "gdocs", "url": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/<file-id>/edit"}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Ports:** this service runs on **8005** (team-tracking 8000, documentation-system 8001, llm 8002, verification 8003, meeting 8004) — chosen to avoid colliding when running the services locally.

### Environment tiers (`CONNECTORS_ENV`)

`CONNECTORS_ENV` declares which environment this instance represents: `local` (default), `staging`, or `production`. Outside `local`, `create_app()` calls `verify_production_secrets()` and **refuses to start** unless `API_KEY` is overridden from the dev default — a misconfigured deploy dies at boot, not on first request. `CONSUMER_KEYS` is also validated at boot (`get_key_store()` is called eagerly in `create_app()`), so a malformed value fails the container immediately rather than on the first `/fetch` call.

Google credentials are deliberately **not** part of that boot check: `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` may be empty in any tier. A connectors deploy with no Google account yet still starts, serves `/health`, and returns 503 for Google source fetches.

### Configuration

All settings load from the environment (`src/config.py`, `.env` in dev):

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `CONNECTORS_ENV` | `local` | Environment tier (`local` / `staging` / `production`). |
| `API_KEY` | `dev-api-key-change-me` | Env-bootstrap key; carries `admin` scope. Must be overridden outside `local`. |
| `CONSUMER_KEYS` | `""` | JSON array of per-consumer keys (see auth model). |
| `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` | `""` | Base64 of the Google service-account JSON key file. Empty is a valid running state — see the runbook below. |
| `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS` | `1200000` | Transport guard: truncates fetched content above this length. Deliberately set above documentation-system's own `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS` (1,000,000) so that clamp — not this one — is the one that actually trips and reports a truncation warning. |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S` | `30` | Per-request timeout to upstream sources (seconds). |

## Auth model

Auth is scoped API keys via the shared `platform_auth` package, matching `llm`, team-tracking, and documentation-system — but **DB-free**. There is no `api_keys` table.

- Every request needs `X-API-Key`. A key is either the shared bootstrap env key (`API_KEY`, scope: `admin`) or a per-consumer key seeded from the `CONSUMER_KEYS` env var.
- **`CONSUMER_KEYS` is a JSON array**, each entry `{"name", "prefix", "key_hash", "scopes"}`. At boot, the key store is built from it into an in-memory store that satisfies `platform_auth`'s `ApiKeyStore` protocol. Keys are stored only as Argon2 hashes; a malformed `CONSUMER_KEYS` fails fast at startup.
- Keys use the **`connectors_` envelope** (`connectors_<prefix>_<secret>`). There is no `X-Actor` header — this is a service-to-service API, so the audit actor is always the authenticated key's own name (attested actor).

### Minting consumer keys

Use the `connectors-keys` CLI. It prints the plaintext key **once** to stdout and the `CONSUMER_KEYS` JSON entry to stderr — it does not (and cannot) write to any store:

```bash
uv run connectors-keys --name documentation-system --scopes fetch
# stdout: connectors_<prefix>_<secret>   (the key — give it to the consumer, shown ONCE)
# stderr: {"name": "documentation-system", "prefix": "...", "key_hash": "$argon2id$...", "scopes": ["fetch"]}
```

Append the printed JSON object to the service's `CONSUMER_KEYS` array and redeploy. To **revoke** a key, drop its entry from `CONSUMER_KEYS` and redeploy — there is no revoke command because there is no database.

## API at a glance

Every endpoint except `/health` requires `X-API-Key`.

| Method | Path | Scope | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| POST | `/fetch` | `fetch` | Fetch a document's text content from a source. |
| GET | `/health` | none | Liveness probe → `{"status": "ok"}`. |

`POST /fetch` requires the `fetch` scope (`require_scope("fetch")`); the `admin` wildcard satisfies it, so the bootstrap key and any admin key also work.

**Request body** (`FetchRequest`, `contracts/fetch.py`):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `url` | string | Required, non-empty. The document URL. |
| `source_id` | string | Required, non-empty. Which source to use (e.g. `gdocs`, `gsheets`, `gslides`, `gdrive`). Supplied by the caller — the caller (e.g. documentation-system) already resolves this during ingest, so it is not re-derived here. |

**Response** (`FetchResponse`): `{ "title", "content", "warnings": [] }`.

### Error → status table

| Condition | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `source_id` not registered | 422 |
| Source not configured (e.g. `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` empty, or malformed) | 503 |
| Source denied access to the file (not shared with the service account) | 403 |
| File not found for the given URL | 404 |
| File's MIME type has no text form the service can extract | 422 |
| Upstream source error (Drive/Docs API failure) | 502 |
| Missing/invalid `X-API-Key` | 401 |
| Valid key without the `fetch` scope | 403 |
| Malformed request body | 422 |

## Google service-account setup runbook

connectors reads Google Docs/Sheets/Slides/Drive files as a **service account** — a robot identity, not a user login. The account only sees files explicitly shared with it; there is no folder allowlist inside this service, because Drive's sharing settings *are* the access control.

1. **Create (or reuse) a Google Cloud project** for UTMIST connectors.
2. **Enable all four required APIs** on that project:
   - **Google Drive API** — always required. Used for file metadata (name, MIME type) on every fetch, and as the export fallback for uploaded `text/*` files.
   - **Google Docs API** — required for the native Docs extractor.
   - **Google Slides API** — required for the native Slides extractor.
   - **Google Sheets API** — required for the native Sheets extractor.
3. **Create a service account** in that project (IAM & Admin → Service Accounts).
4. **Create a JSON key** for the service account and download it. Treat this file as a secret — do not commit it.
5. **Share each Drive folder/file connectors needs to read** with the service account's email address (looks like `name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`), granting **Viewer** access. Nothing is readable until it's explicitly shared.
6. **Base64-encode the key file** and set it as `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON`:
   ```bash
   base64 -i service-account.json | tr -d '\n'
   ```
   Paste the result into `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` (in `.env` locally, or as a Railway variable in staging/production).

### Scopes

The service account's credentials are built with these OAuth scopes:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` — always required (file metadata on every fetch, plus the Drive-export fallback for uploaded `text/*` files).
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly` — required for the native Docs extractor.
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations.readonly` — required for the native Slides extractor.
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly` — required for the native Sheets extractor.

Both `required_scopes()` and `required_services()` (`src/sources/google.py`) union across the registered extractors automatically — a new extractor just declares the scopes/services it needs, and those functions pick it up without being edited.

Adding a native extractor for an existing Google API (Docs/Slides/Sheets) is one new file plus one registry entry — true today only because `_API_VERSIONS` in `google.py` already maps `"slides"` and `"sheets"` to their API versions. Wiring up a genuinely new Google API (e.g. Forms) additionally needs one line added to `_API_VERSIONS`; `_build_services` raises `SourceNotConfigured` for any service name not in that map, so a missing entry fails loudly rather than silently.

### Known limitation: large spreadsheet tabs

Every tab of a spreadsheet is read (there is no first-tab-only limitation). The one remaining lossy case is a single tab with more than `MAX_ROWS_PER_TAB` (2000) rows: that tab is truncated to the first 2000 rows and a warning naming the tab and its real row count is added to the response's `warnings` list. Slides and Docs have no equivalent size cap.

### Running without Google access

`GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` empty is a valid, supported running state: `/fetch` returns **503** for any Google source, and every other part of the service (health check, auth, non-Google sources if added later) works normally. This means connectors can be deployed and wired up to consumers **before** the Google Cloud project and service account exist — flip on Google support later by setting the variable and redeploying, no code change required.

## Testing

The suite is single-mode — no Docker, no database, no network:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Runs **99 tests** with Google API clients injected as fakes via `app.dependency_overrides` / constructor injection, covering the `/fetch` happy path, URL parsing, the Docs/Slides/Sheets extractors, the Drive-export fallback for uploaded `text/*` files, the auth paths, config/boot checks, and the source-error → HTTP-status mapping.

Lint and format with ruff:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

**CI** runs a `connectors-test` job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `uv sync --extra dev`, `uv run pytest`, `ruff check`, and `ruff format --check`. The `docker-build` job builds the Dockerfile and smoke-tests that the app imports at boot (`python -c "import src.api.app"`).

## Status

v0.1: a stateless `POST /fetch` adapter over a Google Drive/Docs/Slides/Sheets service account, config-seeded scoped API keys (`fetch` / `admin`) with an attested-actor audit trail, and a fast 99-test suite with no external dependencies.

**Not implemented (by design):**

- **Persistence** — no database. Consumers that need to cache fetched content own that cache themselves.
- **Per-end-user authorization** — connectors authenticates the calling service, not the end user on whose behalf a fetch happens; that check belongs in the consumer.
- **Non-Google sources** — the source registry is designed to grow (`SourceFetcher` protocol), but only Google Drive/Docs/Sheets/Slides is wired up today.
