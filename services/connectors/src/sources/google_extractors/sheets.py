    round-trips identically quoted or not). The real ambiguity is narrower:
    an apostrophe in the title would terminate a quoted string early (so it
    must be doubled), and a title that looks like a cell reference (e.g.
    "Q1", "A1") or contains "!" (the sheet/range separator) is ambiguous
    unquoted. Google's own guidance is that it is always safe to quote, and
    quoting is a no-op for titles that already work unquoted, so every title
    is quoted unconditionally rather than special-casing which ones need it.
