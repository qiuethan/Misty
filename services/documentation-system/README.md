# documentation-system

Source-of-truth HTTP API for UTMIST's document catalog: a registry of URLs (docs, sheets, slides, repos, videos) with owners, tags, and lightweight content snapshots.

## What this service does

UTMIST accumulates links faster than anyone can track them — onboarding docs on Google Drive, budget sheets, GitHub repos, Notion pages, YouTube recordings. Nobody owns a canonical index of "what exists and who's responsible for it," so links rot, duplicate, or vanish when the one person who bookmarked them graduates.

The documentation-system service is that canonical index. It exposes a REST API over two core concepts:

- **Docs** — a URL plus metadata: title, description, owning team/person, tags, an optional best-effort content snapshot, and an active flag (soft delete).
- **Sources** — a registry of URL "kinds" (`web`, `github`, `gdrive`, `gdocs`, `gsheets`, `gslides`, `notion`, `youtube`) that says whether a source requires auth to fetch, has an API, and whether content fetching is even enabled for it.

Content fetching is **egress-guarded (SSRF protection).** Ingesting a URL only ever fetches public, allowlisted hosts: the fetcher enforces an http/https scheme allowlist, resolves the target host, and refuses any private/loopback/link-local/reserved/carrier-grade-NAT or cloud-metadata (`169.254.169.254`) address — before the request and again on every redirect hop. The connection is pinned to the validated IP (Host header + TLS SNI preserved) so DNS-rebinding can't slip an internal target past the check. A blocked or malformed URL is surfaced as an ordinary fetch failure (the doc is still catalogued with the URL as its title), never a 500.

Ingesting a URL is idempotent: re-submitting a known URL merges new tags onto the existing doc rather than creating a duplicate. De-duplication is enforced at the database level — a partial unique index on `url_normalized WHERE active` (migration 004) guarantees at most one active row per normalized URL, so concurrent adds of the same URL converge on a single canonical doc instead of racing to create duplicates, and re-adding a URL that was previously soft-removed reuses/re-catalogues it rather than piling up duplicate active entries. Ownership (`owning_team_id` / `owning_person_id`) is validated against UTMIST's team-tracking service when reachable, and degrades gracefully (id stored, label resolved later) when it isn't — the catalog never blocks on a downstream directory outage.

## Dependency on the team-tracking directory

The documentation-system is the catalog; the [team-tracking](../team-tracking/) service is the **source of truth** for people and teams. When you ingest or update a doc with an `owning_team_id` or `owning_person_id`, this service calls team-tracking over HTTP (`GET /teams/{id}`, `GET /people/{id}`) to validate the id and cache its human-readable label.

Two things follow from this:

- **team-tracking is a runtime dependency.** For ownership validation you need a reachable directory at `DIRECTORY_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`) and a directory API key (`DIRECTORY_API_KEY`).
- **degrade-on-directory-down.** If the directory is unreachable (connection failure or 5xx), ingest does not fail. The owner id is stored, the label is left null with a warning, and a later read or update backfills the label once the directory is reachable again. A directory that *is* reachable but returns 404 for the id is a genuine "unknown owner" error (HTTP 400), not a degrade.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full data flow.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Docker, Python 3.11+, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
# 0. From the repo root, enter the service directory (all commands below run here)
cd services/documentation-system

# 1. Copy environment config and start Postgres
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres

# 2. Install dependencies (including dev tools)
uv sync --extra dev

# 3. Apply database migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# 4. Start the API server
uv run uvicorn src.api.app:app --reload --port 8001
```

> The repo is a single [uv workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/workspaces/) (root `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.uv.workspace] members = ["services/*", "packages/*"]`, one root `uv.lock`). documentation-system depends on the shared `platform-auth` package (`[tool.uv.sources] platform-auth = { workspace = true }`) but the commands above are unchanged — `uv sync`, `uv run pytest`, `uv run alembic` still work exactly as shown when run from this directory.

The API is now running at `http://localhost:8001`. Interactive Swagger UI is at `http://localhost:8001/swagger` (note: relocated from `/docs`, since `/docs` is the docs-resource router). Machine-readable OpenAPI schema is at `GET /openapi.json`.

The default dev API key is `dev-api-key-change-me` (set in `.env`). Pass it as `X-API-Key` on every request:

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8001/sources \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me" | python3 -m json.tool
```

**For production, use per-consumer scoped keys instead of the shared env key.** Issue them via the CLI:

```bash
# Issue a read/write key for an ingestion bot
uv run doc-keys issue --name slack-bot --scopes docs:read docs:write
# Prints: doc_<prefix>_<secret>  (shown ONCE — capture it now)

# List existing keys (metadata only, never plaintext)
uv run doc-keys list --active-only

# Revoke a compromised key
uv run doc-keys revoke <api_key_id>
```

Scopes: `docs:{read,write}`, `admin` (wildcard). See the auth model section below for how attested actors and audit fields work.

**Ports:** this service runs on **8001** (team-tracking uses 8000) and its Postgres container is exposed on **5434** — both chosen to avoid colliding with team-tracking's defaults when running both services locally.

**Dependency direction:** `contracts/` has no imports from `src/`. `src/api/` depends only on `contracts/` and `src/config`, `src/ingest`, `src/fetch`, `src/directory`. `src/storage/`, `src/fetch/`, and `src/directory/` each implement a `contracts/` Protocol and know nothing about FastAPI. `src/api/deps.py` is the only place concrete adapters get wired to their Protocols.

## The three boundaries

The service is built around three swappable Protocols, so no concrete dependency (a specific database, a specific fetch strategy, a specific directory service) leaks into the ingest/API layers:

- **`StorageAdapter`** (`contracts/storage.py`) — persistence for docs, sources, and API keys. Two implementations: `InMemoryStorageAdapter` (tests) and `PostgresStorageAdapter` (production). Swapping to Postgres in Task 15 required zero changes to `src/ingest.py` or the routers.
- **`Fetcher`** (`contracts/fetcher.py`) — `fetch(url) -> FetchResult`. `FetcherRegistry` maps a `source_id` to a concrete fetcher (`web.py`, `github.py`); unknown or auth-required sources simply skip fetching. The web fetcher applies SSRF egress protection (public-host allowlist, private/metadata-IP block, per-hop IP pinning) and rejects a blocked or malformed URL as a `BlockedURLError` (a `FetchError` subclass). Fetch failures raise `FetchError`, which `ingest_doc` catches and turns into a warning — a doc is still created with the URL as its title.
- **`DirectoryClient`** (`contracts/directory.py`) — `get_team_label` / `get_person_label`, backed by `HttpDirectoryClient` calling UTMIST's team-tracking service. When team-tracking is unreachable, `DirectoryUnavailable` is caught and ingest degrades: the id is stored, the label is left null with a warning, and a later read/update backfills the label once the directory is reachable again (see `_backfill_labels` in `src/api/routers/docs.py`).

## Auth model

Auth is **Level 2** (scoped API keys), matching team-tracking:

- Every request needs `X-API-Key`. Keys are either the shared bootstrap env key (`API_KEY`, scope: `admin`) or a per-consumer key issued via the `doc-keys` CLI, stored as an Argon2 hash with a `docs:{read,write}` or `admin` scope set.
- There is **no `X-Actor` header** — the actor stamped on `created_by`/`updated_by`/audit log entries is always the authenticated key's own name (`AuthedKey.name`). A caller cannot claim to be someone else; this is the "attested actor" model.
- `require_scope("docs:read")` / `require_scope("docs:write")` gate each route; `admin` is a wildcard scope that satisfies any check.
- `AuditLogMiddleware` (`src/api/middleware.py`) logs every request with the resolved actor.
- Manage keys with the CLI:
  ```bash
  uv run doc-keys issue --name my-consumer --scopes docs:read docs:write
  uv run doc-keys list --active-only
  uv run doc-keys revoke <api_key_id>
  ```

## API at a glance

All endpoints require `X-API-Key` with the appropriate scope.

| Method | Path | Scope | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| POST | `/docs` | `docs:write` | Ingest a URL (idempotent; 200 if already catalogued, 201 if new) |
| GET | `/docs` | `docs:read` | List docs (`?owning_team_id=&owning_person_id=&source_id=&tag=&active_only=true`) |
| GET | `/docs/{id}` | `docs:read` | Get one doc (backfills owner labels if previously unresolved) |
| PATCH | `/docs/{id}` | `docs:write` | Update a doc (title, description, owner ids, active flag) |
| POST | `/docs/{id}/tags` | `docs:write` | Add a tag |
| DELETE | `/docs/{id}/tags/{tag}` | `docs:write` | Remove a tag |
| POST | `/docs/{id}/refetch` | `docs:write` | Re-run content fetch for an existing doc |
| GET | `/sources` | `docs:read` | List sources (`?active_only=false`) |
| GET | `/sources/{id}` | `docs:read` | Get one source |

Machine-readable OpenAPI schema: `GET /openapi.json`. Interactive Swagger UI: `GET /swagger`.

## Testing

The test suite has two modes:

**Fast (in-memory, no Docker required):**
```bash
uv run pytest --ignore=tests/test_postgres_adapter.py -q
```

This runs **59 tests** using `InMemoryStorageAdapter` injected via FastAPI's `dependency_overrides`, plus fakes for `Fetcher` and `DirectoryClient`. `tests/conftest.py` provides `build_seed_sources()`, a shared 8-source seed matching migration 002, used across the in-memory adapter, ingest, API, and OpenAPI tests. Runs in well under a second.

Running the whole suite *without* `RUN_PG_TESTS` reports **59 passed, 7 skipped** — the 7 skipped are the Postgres integration tests in `tests/test_postgres_adapter.py`.

**Full (includes Postgres integration):**
```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
RUN_PG_TESTS=1 uv run pytest -q
```

`tests/test_postgres_adapter.py` runs the same behavioral assertions against a live Postgres instance and is gated behind the `RUN_PG_TESTS=1` environment variable so it's skipped by default (and in the fast suite above). Requires `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` pointing at the running container on port 5434.

Lint before committing:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

## Status

v1 covers: the docs + sources registry, idempotent ingest with DB-enforced dedup (partial unique index on active URLs), best-effort content fetching with SSRF egress protection and graceful degradation, team-tracking-backed ownership with label backfill, tag management, soft delete (`active` flag), Level 2 scoped API keys with an attested-actor audit trail, and both storage adapters — 59 passing fast tests (plus 7 Postgres integration tests behind `RUN_PG_TESTS`).

**Deferred (per design §3/§11 non-goals):**

- Full-text / semantic search over `content_snapshot` — the snapshot is stored for future indexing but no search endpoint exists yet.
- Scheduled/background refetching — `POST /docs/{id}/refetch` is on-demand only; no cron or queue re-fetches stale snapshots.
- Additional fetchers — only `web` and `github` fetchers exist; Google Drive/Docs/Sheets/Slides, Notion, and YouTube are registered as sources but have no fetcher implementation yet (auth-gated sources skip fetching by design).
- Bulk import — ingest is one URL per request; no CSV/bulk endpoint.
- Pagination — list endpoints return all matching rows, adequate for current catalog size.
- Admin UI — no dashboard; catalog browsing goes through the API or a future thin client.
