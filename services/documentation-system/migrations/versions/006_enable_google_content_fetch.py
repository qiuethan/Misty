"""sources: enable content fetching for the Google sources

The Google sources were seeded content_fetch_enabled=false in migration 002
because no fetcher existed. The connectors service now provides one, so ingest
should attempt a fetch. A missing credential is non-fatal: the fetch fails,
ingest records a warning, and the doc is still catalogued.
