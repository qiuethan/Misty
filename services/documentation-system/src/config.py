    `api_key` is the inbound env-bootstrap admin key (src/api/auth.py); when it
    is the committed default it is publicly known. `directory_api_key` is an
    outbound credential this service presents to the directory service, which
    it depends on hard: every doc's owner and every access decision is
    resolved against directory, so a default there is a broken prod config
    and must block startup.

    `connectors_api_key` is different in kind, not just degree: connectors is
    a soft dependency. It only backs the four Google-backed sources (`gdocs`,
    `gsheets`, `gslides`, `gdrive`) — `web` and `github` fetch in-process and
    never touch it — and `ingest_doc` is designed to turn a connectors
    `FetchError` into a per-doc warning while still cataloguing the doc (see
    src/ingest.py). Losing connectors means "no Google content," not "broken
    catalog," so a default `connectors_api_key` gets a startup warning
    instead of a boot refusal (see below). This mirrors connectors' own
    `verify_production_secrets` (services/connectors/src/config.py), which
    deliberately excludes `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` for the same reason: a
    connectors service that can't reach Drive is degraded, not broken, and
    must still boot.

    Called from create_app(), so a misconfigured deploy dies at startup, not
    on first request.

    All three checks below MUST go through .get_secret_value(). A SecretStr
    never compares equal to a str, so `settings.api_key == DEFAULT_DEV_API_KEY`
    would silently evaluate False forever — the service would boot happily to
    staging/production with the committed dev secret and nothing would say so.
