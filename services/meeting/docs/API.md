# meeting — API reference

Base URL (local): `http://localhost:8004` · Swagger UI: `/docs` · Schema: `/openapi.json`

> **The WebSocket route is not in OpenAPI.** `/openapi.json` covers the HTTP routes only — WebSockets aren't representable in the spec. The wire format below is the contract; the Discord bot's voice surface mirrors it.

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | none | Liveness probe |
| WS | `/meetings/{id}/stream` | `?key=` or first frame | Live audio ingest + control |
| GET | `/meetings/{id}/transcript` | `X-API-Key` | Poll the rolling transcript |
| POST | `/meetings/{id}/stop` | `X-API-Key` | Finalize: transcript + minutes + PDF |

## Authentication

```
X-API-Key: meeting_<prefix>_<secret>
```

A key is either the bootstrap env key (`API_KEY`, carries `admin`) or a per-consumer key from `CONSUMER_KEYS`. A **single scope, `meetings`**, covers every protected endpoint — HTTP and WS alike. This service has one internal consumer class (the Discord bot), so separate read/write/stream scopes were a deliberate simplification. `admin` satisfies it. `/health` is the unauthenticated exception.

## `session_id`

Must match `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$`. The service writes nothing to disk, so this is input hygiene rather than path safety.

A `session_id` unknown to the in-memory registry returns **404** on `/transcript` and `/stop`. "Unknown" covers three cases that are indistinguishable from outside: never started, already stopped, or **the process restarted**. Sessions live only in memory.

---

## `WS /meetings/{session_id}/stream`

```
ws://.../meetings/{session_id}/stream?key=<consumer-key>&guild_id=<guild-id>
```

### Handshake

| Param | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | preferred | Validated **before** the socket is accepted; a bad key is rejected at the handshake |
| `guild_id` | optional | Passed to session creation. Omitted → `session_id` is used as the guild_id |

If `key` is omitted from the query string, the server accepts the socket and requires the **first** message to be a text frame `{"key": "..."}`. Missing, malformed, or invalid → closed with **1008** (policy violation) before any audio is processed.

Close code **1008** is also used for: an invalid `session_id` (before any session is created), and a second connect for an already-active `session_id` (the existing session is left untouched).

### Messages the server accepts

**1. Control — WebSocket text frames, UTF-8 JSON.**

```json
{"speaker_id": "<id>", "display_name": "<name>"}
```

Registers or updates the display name for a speaker. Send whenever a speaker's identity becomes known. Until one arrives, the `speaker_id` itself is used as the display name.

```json
{"end_of_audio": true}
```

Send **once**, after the recording stops and every captured frame has been forwarded. Because the socket delivers in order, this proves all audio has arrived, and `POST /stop` waits for it before finalizing.

Without it — an older client, a crash, a dropped socket — `/stop` proceeds after a 5 s drain timeout and logs a warning. The transcript tail may then be short, which is exactly the failure this signal prevents. **Send it.**

Unknown or malformed text frames are ignored, not fatal.

**2. Audio — WebSocket binary frames**, one raw Opus packet each:

```text
[2 bytes,  big-endian uint16]  speaker_id_len
[speaker_id_len bytes, UTF-8]  speaker_id
[8 bytes,  big-endian uint64]  ts_ms
[remaining bytes]              raw Opus packet payload
```

A length-prefixed speaker id, an 8-byte millisecond timestamp, then the raw Opus payload with no further framing. Truncated or undersized frames are dropped and counted, not fatal.

### Disconnect

Disconnecting (or erroring) **without** a preceding `POST /stop` tears the session down via `discard()` — abort each speaker's Transcribe stream, deregister, done. It deliberately skips the finalize pipeline, so **no minutes and no PDF are produced**. That pipeline involves a blocking `llm` call not worth paying for when nobody is waiting for the result.

To get minutes, call `POST /stop` before closing the socket.

---

## `GET /meetings/{session_id}/transcript`

Poll the rolling transcript of an active session.

**Response** (`TranscriptView`) — `200`:

```json
{"segments": [
  {"speaker": "Alex Chen", "start_ms": 12400, "text": "Let's start with sponsorship."},
  {"speaker": "Sam Patel", "start_ms": 19100, "text": "I've got the deck ready."}
]}
```

**Polling is free.** It reads what each speaker's live Transcribe stream has already finalized — no AWS call, no audio re-sent, no cost. Poll as often as you like.

It is a **cumulative view, not a diff**. Each response is the whole transcript so far; there is no cursor or append stream. `start_ms` is meeting-relative, mapped back from each speaker's stream-relative timings.

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| `session_id` fails the regex | 400 `invalid session_id` |
| Session not in the registry | 404 `unknown session` |
| Missing key / no `meetings` scope | 401 / 403 |

---

## `POST /meetings/{session_id}/stop`

End the session and get everything back. This is the only call that produces minutes.

What it does, in order: wait for the end-of-audio barrier (max 5 s) → close the Transcribe streams → assemble the final transcript → call `llm` for minutes → render the PDF → tear the session down.

**Response** (`StopResponse`) — `200`:

```json
{
  "transcript": "[00:12] Alex Chen: Let's start with sponsorship.\n[00:19] Sam Patel: I've got the deck ready.",
  "minutes": {
    "title": "Sponsorship Sync",
    "summary": "The team reviewed ...",
    "decisions": ["Target three tiers for 2026"],
    "action_items": ["Sam to send the deck by Friday"]
  },
  "pdf_b64": "JVBERi0xLjQK..."
}
```

`transcript` is one line per segment, formatted `[MM:SS] speaker: text` and sorted by `start_ms` (`pipeline/transcript.py`). Segments at or past one hour use `[HH:MM:SS]` instead — reachable, since `MAX_MEETING_MS` defaults to 4 h. `pipeline/pdf.py` splits on `"] "` so it handles both; don't change the format without changing both.

`pdf_b64` is the base64-encoded minutes PDF. `minutes.title` may be an empty string, in which case the PDF falls back to a generic title.

**If `llm` is unreachable, `/stop` still returns 200** — `minutes` comes back as `{"summary": "(minutes unavailable: LLM service error)", "decisions": [], "action_items": []}` with a PDF built around it. There is no error status for a failed summarization; check the `summary` string.

**No meeting audio is returned, ever.** Audio exists only as transcription input — never mixed, never persisted, never written to disk.

**The session is gone after this call.** It is deregistered as part of stopping, so a subsequent `/transcript` or `/stop` returns 404. Persist the response — this service retains nothing.

This call is **slow relative to the others**: it blocks on the drain barrier, the Transcribe flush, and an LLM round trip. Budget accordingly; `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S` (default 60) bounds the `llm` leg.

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| `session_id` fails the regex | 400 `invalid session_id` |
| Session not in the registry | 404 `unknown session` |
| Missing key / no `meetings` scope | 401 / 403 |

## `GET /health`

Unauthenticated liveness probe. Railway's healthcheck path.

```json
{"status": "ok"}
```

Answers `200` without AWS credentials or a reachable `llm`. A green healthcheck does **not** imply transcription or minutes generation work.

## Constraints worth designing around

- **One process owns a session end-to-end.** No sticky routing means misrouted `/transcript` and `/stop`. Do not scale to multiple replicas without it.
- **A restart loses every in-flight meeting.** Nothing is persisted.
- **`MAX_MEETING_MS`** (default 14,400,000 = 4 h) is a backstop: a session stops accepting audio past it. 4 h is also Amazon Transcribe's per-stream cap.
- **One open Transcribe stream per active speaker**, for the whole meeting. Large meetings can hit the account's concurrent-stream quota.
