"""Decode bare Discord Opus packets into 16 kHz mono s16le PCM.

Discord voice delivers ONE bare Opus packet per ~20ms WS frame (48 kHz,
2 channels, 960 samples/channel) -- there is no Ogg/container framing around
it. ffmpeg has no demuxer that can make sense of a standalone Opus packet fed
in one at a time (there's no elementary-stream reader for "raw Opus"; ffmpeg's
Opus support expects either an Ogg container or a full RTP/WebM stream with
header packets). Feeding bare packets through ``ffmpeg -f data -c:a libopus``
fails live with "Stream #0:0: Data: none" / "Output file does not contain any
stream" (exit 234) -- confirmed against real Discord audio.

The fix is a real, stateful Opus decoder (via PyAV, which bundles its own
ffmpeg/libopus so it installs cleanly in ``python:3.11-slim`` with no extra
system package): one decoder instance per speaker, fed packets in order.
