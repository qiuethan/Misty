"""Stateful in-process session registry + meeting lifecycle orchestration.

All collaborators (transcriber factory, audio decoder, report builder, clock)
are injected via a ``deps`` dict so this module has zero direct dependency on
AWS/network -- tests use fakes exclusively.

Nothing here touches the filesystem, and nothing retains the audio: each PCM
chunk is handed straight to that speaker's Transcribe stream and dropped.
Audio is never persisted and never returned (see ``stop``).

Transcription is LIVE: each speaker gets one persistent AWS Transcribe stream
(``src/stt/transcribe.py``) opened on their first frame and fed as audio
arrives. ``transcript_view()`` is then a pure read of what that stream has
finalized so far -- no AWS call, no audio replayed -- and ``stop()`` just closes
the streams and collects their final results.

This replaced a design that re-transcribed each speaker's WHOLE accumulated
buffer on every poll and again at stop. That made AWS cost grow with the SQUARE
of meeting length (k polls re-sent ~k/2 copies of the audio), made each poll
progressively slower, and forced every speaker's PCM to be retained in memory
for the life of the meeting. None of that is true any more: nothing here keeps
the audio, because nothing replays it.
