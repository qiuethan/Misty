# API Reference

Full endpoint reference for `team-tracking` v1.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for design decisions. The machine-readable OpenAPI schema is at `GET /openapi.json`. Interactive Swagger UI is at `GET /docs`.

## Base URL and auth

Local development: `http://localhost:8000`. In staging/production the API is deployed to Railway and reachable **only over Railway's private network** (no public domain) — consumers (bot, docs-system) hit it at `http://team-tracking.railway.internal:8000`. External access is a one-click "add public domain" in Railway if ever needed.

Every request — read or write — must include a valid **scoped API key** in the `X-API-Key` header:

```
X-API-Key: tt_<prefix>_<secret>
```

Keys are issued by an operator via the `team-tracking-keys` CLI (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)) and have the format `tt_<prefix>_<secret>`: an 8-char public prefix used for lookup, and a secret verified against a stored argon2 hash. The plaintext is shown once at issuance and never recoverable. A legacy env bootstrap key (the `API_KEY` setting) is also accepted with `admin` scope, but is deprecated — real consumers get their own scoped key.

If the key is missing, malformed, or unrecognized, the endpoint returns `401 Unauthorized`. Every failure mode returns the same 401 body — the API never leaks which check failed.

### Scopes

Each endpoint requires a specific scope. A key only reaches an endpoint if its scopes include the required one (or the wildcard `admin`); otherwise the response is `403 Forbidden`.

| Domain | Scopes |
|--------|--------|
| People | `people:read`, `people:write` |
| Teams | `teams:read`, `teams:write` |
| Role kinds | `role_kinds:read` |
| Memberships | `memberships:read`, `memberships:write` |
| Providers | `providers:read` |
| Identifiers | `identifiers:read`, `identifiers:write` |
| Dev-only | `dev:spoof` — local-dev only; refused against `TT_ENV=production` at both issuance and request time |
| Wildcard | `admin` — grants every scope, but does NOT satisfy the `dev:spoof` guard |

The required scope for each endpoint is listed in its section below.

The **`dev:spoof`** scope is the discord-bot playground's declaration that it
runs in a spoofable dev environment. It is not required by any endpoint; its
presence gates the discord-bot's own startup guard (which refuses to enable
its "Acting as any Discord ID" mode without it). Team-tracking, in turn,
refuses to *issue* keys with this scope against `TT_ENV=production` — and
refuses to *serve* requests bearing them against production, even if the key
somehow slipped in via a copied DB. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for
`TT_ENV` semantics.

### Attested actor (`created_by` / `updated_by`)

Writes stamp `created_by` and `updated_by` with the **name of the key that made the request** — cryptographically attested, not self-declared. There is no need to send an actor header: if you issue a key named `discord-bot`, every write it makes is recorded as `discord-bot`.

> The `X-Actor` header exists only for backward compatibility with the deprecated env bootstrap key, and is **ignored for DB-issued keys**. A leaked key can no longer impersonate someone else by setting a header. The `X-Actor` values shown in some curl examples below are inert for scoped keys — they document the legacy behavior only.

```bash
# Read request — the key must carry the endpoint's :read scope
curl -sS http://localhost:8000/people \
  -H "X-API-Key: tt_ab12cd34_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Write request — actor is taken from the key name; no header needed
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8000/people \
  -H "X-API-Key: tt_ab12cd34_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"display_name": "Alex Chen", "primary_email": "alex@utmist.ca"}'
```

## Error conventions

| Status | When |
|--------|------|
| `400 Bad Request` | Invalid FK on membership create/update (person_id, team_id, or role_kind_id not found); unknown provider on identifier create |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing, malformed, or unrecognized `X-API-Key` |
| `403 Forbidden` | Key is valid but lacks the scope the endpoint requires |
| `404 Not Found` | Resource with the given ID or slug does not exist; unknown person/identifier link, or unlinked reverse lookup |
| `409 Conflict` | Uniqueness violation: `primary_email` already taken, team `slug` already taken, person already has that provider linked, or (provider, external_id) belongs to another person |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Pydantic validation failure: wrong type, missing required field, or field rejected by validator (e.g., slug contains uppercase) |

Error responses always include a `detail` field in the JSON body describing the problem.

> The curl examples below use the dev bootstrap key `dev-api-key-change-me` so they work against a fresh local `.env`. In production, substitute a real issued `tt_<prefix>_<secret>` key with the scope the endpoint requires.

## API keys (self-introspection)

### GET /api-keys/self

Return the calling key's own name and scopes. **Scope:** none beyond a valid
API key — any authenticated caller can introspect its own key.

Used primarily by consumers (e.g., the discord-bot) to decide at startup
whether they hold the scopes required for the mode they intend to run in.

**Response** (`200 OK`):

```json
{
  "name": "discord-bot-playground",
  "scopes": ["dev:spoof", "identifiers:read", "identifiers:write", "people:read", "people:write"]
}
```

`scopes` is sorted alphabetically. `name` is the exact string used when the
key was issued via `team-tracking-keys issue --name ...`.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8000/api-keys/self \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

Returns `401` if the key is missing or invalid. Never returns `403` (there
is no scope to lack).

## People

### POST /people

Create a new person. **Scope:** `people:write`.

**Request body:**

### GET /people/by-email/{email}

Resolve a person by their `primary_email` (case-insensitive). Declared before
`GET /people/{person_id}` so the literal path is not parsed as a UUID.

- **404** → no person with that email

Used by the Discord bot to resolve a member's email to their directory Person
during `/link`.

}
```

List all teams. **Scope:** `teams:read`.

**Query parameters:**

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `active_only` | boolean | `false` | If `true`, returns only teams with `active = true` |

**Response:** Array of `Team` objects, HTTP 200.

| Param | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `slug` | string | |

**Response:** `Team` object, HTTP 200.

**Errors:** 404 if no team has that slug.

Note: FastAPI routes are matched in declaration order. `GET /teams/by-slug/{slug}` is declared before `GET /teams/{team_id}` in the router, so the literal segment `by-slug` is matched first and never interpreted as a UUID.

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/teams/by-slug/partnerships" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

---

| `parent_id` | UUID | FK → teams.id; pass `null` to make top-level |
| `active` | boolean | Set to `false` to retire a team |

**Response:** Updated `Team` object, HTTP 200.

**Errors:** 404 if not found. 409 if new `slug` conflicts. 422 if slug format is invalid.

```bash
curl -sS -X PATCH "http://localhost:8000/teams/660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001" \

```

---

## Providers

Providers are the controlled vocabulary of identity provider types. The four seed values are `discord`, `github`, `notion`, and `uoft_email`. They are read-only through the API (no create/update endpoints). Both endpoints require scope `providers:read`.

### GET /providers

List all providers.

**Query parameters:**

curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/providers" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"

# Active providers only
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/providers?active_only=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

**Response shape (one item):**

**Errors:** 404 if not found.

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/providers/discord" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

---

## Person identifiers

A `PersonIdentifier` row records that a person holds an external account on a given provider (e.g., Discord account snowflake, GitHub username). Each person can have at most one link per provider. Identity mappings are current state, not history: unlinking hard-deletes the row via the DELETE endpoint (a deliberate exception to the "never hard-delete" convention for people/teams/memberships). Re-linking requires unlink-then-relink.

Identity operations require scopes `identifiers:read` (for GET) and `identifiers:write` (for POST/PATCH/DELETE).

### GET /people/by-identifier/{provider}/{external_id}

Reverse lookup: find the person who owns a given external identifier on a provider. This is the primary identity call for external systems (e.g., Discord bot looking up a user by their snowflake). Returns 404 if the identifier is unlinked.

**Path parameters:**

| Param | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `provider` | string | Provider ID (e.g. `discord`) |
| `external_id` | string | The external identifier (e.g. snowflake, username, email) |

**Response:** `Person` object, HTTP 200.

**Errors:** 404 if the identifier is not linked or the provider does not exist.

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/people/by-identifier/discord/123456789" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

---

### GET /people/{person_id}/identifiers

**Path parameters:**

| Param | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `person_id` | UUID | |

**Response:** Array of `PersonIdentifier` objects, HTTP 200.

**Errors:** 404 if person not found.

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/people/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/identifiers" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

**Response shape:**

```json

## Memberships

A `TeamMembership` row records that a person holds a role on a team for a date range. Rows are never deleted; when someone leaves, the row gains an `ended_at` date.

### POST /memberships

Create a new membership. **Scope:** `memberships:write`.

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `person_id` | UUID | yes | FK → people.id; must exist |
| `team_id` | UUID | yes | FK → teams.id; must exist |
| `role_kind_id` | string | no | FK → role_kinds.id; defaults to `"member"` |
| `is_team_admin` | boolean | no | Default `false` |
| `started_at` | date | no | ISO 8601 date (e.g. `"2026-01-15"`); defaults to today at storage layer |
| `ended_at` | date | no | ISO 8601 date; null = currently active |

**Response:** `TeamMembership` object, HTTP 201.

**Errors:** 400 if `person_id`, `team_id`, or `role_kind_id` does not exist. 422 if required fields are missing or types are wrong.

### GET /memberships

List memberships, with optional filters. All filters are AND-combined. **Scope:** `memberships:read`.

**Query parameters:**

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `team_id` | UUID | — | Filter to memberships on this team |
| `person_id` | UUID | — | Filter to memberships held by this person |
| `active_only` | boolean | `false` | If `true`, returns only rows where `ended_at IS NULL` |
| `as_of` | date | — | ISO 8601 date; returns rows where `started_at <= as_of AND (ended_at IS NULL OR ended_at > as_of)` |
| `is_team_admin` | boolean | — | If provided, filters to rows matching this admin flag |

`active_only` and `as_of` can be combined with `team_id` and `person_id` but should not both be used together (they express different active-at conditions).

**Response:** Array of `TeamMembership` objects, HTTP 200.

```bash
# Current members of the Partnerships team
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships?team_id=660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001&active_only=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"

# All memberships Alex currently holds
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships?person_id=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000&active_only=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"

# Roster as of a past date
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships?team_id=660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001&as_of=2024-12-15" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"

# Current admins of a team
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships?team_id=660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001&is_team_admin=true&active_only=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

### GET /memberships/{membership_id}

Get a single membership by UUID. **Scope:** `memberships:read`.

**Path parameters:**

| Param | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `membership_id` | UUID | |

**Response:** `TeamMembership` object, HTTP 200.

**Errors:** 404 if not found.

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships/770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

---

### PATCH /memberships/{membership_id}

Update one or more fields on a membership. Use this for general edits (changing role, toggling admin flag, or setting `ended_at`). For the specific action of closing a membership, `POST /memberships/{id}/end` is more semantically explicit. **Scope:** `memberships:write`.

**Path parameters:**

| Param | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `membership_id` | UUID | |

**Request body (all fields optional):**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `role_kind_id` | string | FK → role_kinds.id; must exist |
| `is_team_admin` | boolean | |
| `ended_at` | date | ISO 8601 date; set to close the membership |

**Response:** Updated `TeamMembership` object, HTTP 200.

**Errors:** 404 if not found. 400 if `role_kind_id` does not exist.

```bash
# Promote to lead
curl -sS -X PATCH "http://localhost:8000/memberships/770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me" \
  -H "X-Actor: admin" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role_kind_id": "lead"}'

# Grant team admin
curl -sS -X PATCH "http://localhost:8000/memberships/770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"is_team_admin": true}'
```

### POST /memberships/{membership_id}/end

End a membership by setting its `ended_at` date. This is a semantic shortcut over `PATCH /memberships/{id}` with only `ended_at` — it is clearer at the call site that you are closing the membership, not making a general edit. **Scope:** `memberships:write`.

**Path parameters:**

| Param | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `membership_id` | UUID | |

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `ended_at` | date | yes | ISO 8601 date; the last day of membership |

**Response:** Updated `TeamMembership` object with `ended_at` set, HTTP 200.

**Errors:** 404 if not found.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "http://localhost:8000/memberships/770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002/end" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me" \
  -H "X-Actor: admin" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ended_at": "2026-04-30"}'
```

## Common queries recipe book

These examples use placeholder UUIDs. Substitute real IDs from your data.

**Who is currently on the Partnerships team?**

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships?team_id=<partnerships-uuid>&active_only=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

Returns all membership rows with `ended_at IS NULL` for that team. To resolve person details, call `GET /people/{person_id}` for each `person_id` in the results.

**Who are the current team admins of Partnerships?**

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships?team_id=<partnerships-uuid>&is_team_admin=true&active_only=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

**What was the Partnerships roster as of December 15, 2024?**

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships?team_id=<partnerships-uuid>&as_of=2024-12-15" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

Returns rows where `started_at <= 2024-12-15` AND (`ended_at IS NULL` OR `ended_at > 2024-12-15`).

**What teams is Alex currently on?**

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships?person_id=<alex-uuid>&active_only=true" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

**Historical list of VP Partnerships (everyone who has ever held the executive role on Partnerships):**

The schema does not store the string "VP Partnerships." The title is the composite of `role_kind_id = 'executive'` on the Partnerships team. To retrieve the list:

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/memberships?team_id=<partnerships-uuid>" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

Then filter client-side on `role_kind_id == "executive"`. There is no server-side `role_kind_id` filter on `GET /memberships` in v1; if this query is frequent, it is a good candidate for a future query parameter.

**Which person owns this Discord account?**

```bash
curl -sS "http://localhost:8000/people/by-identifier/discord/<snowflake>" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-change-me"
```

This is the reverse-lookup endpoint: given an external identifier (Discord snowflake, GitHub username, UofT email), it returns the `Person` who owns it. Returns 404 if the identifier is not linked. This is the Discord bot's primary identity call.

## OpenAPI

The service generates an OpenAPI 3.x schema automatically from the FastAPI routes and Pydantic models.

- `GET /openapi.json` — machine-readable schema (JSON)
- `GET /docs` — Swagger UI (interactive browser)
- `GET /redoc` — ReDoc UI (alternative browser)

The schema reflects the live code and is always up to date. For integration code generation (e.g., a typed client library), use `/openapi.json` as the source.
